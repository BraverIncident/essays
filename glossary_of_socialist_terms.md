| Communism | It is both our objective and our movement: a stateless classless society that can be attained once global capitalism has been resolved, and the working class liberation movement that intends to establish this society. |
| Socialism | TBD |
| Capitalism | TBD |
| Means of Production | Also known as productive or private property. These are the instruments that labor acts on to create something of value (e.g. factories, mines, and workshops). |
| Personal Property | Not to be confused with private property (means of production), personal property is just that - personal and socially insignificant ownership of things like your car, TV, and toothbrush. Contrary to popular belief, leftists do not want to take away your personal possessions. |
| Materialism | A philosophy that assumes the tangiible world begets the intangible, that the material world shapes our ideas (e.g. Europeans enslaved the Africans because they needed more labor, and resulting slave system created racist ideas of European superiority. |
| Idealism | A philosophy that assumes the tangible world begets the intangible, that ideas exist independent of and shape the material world (e.g. Europeans were born racist and this idea led to the enslavement of Africans. |
| Dialectics | A type of logic that begins with the assumption that nothing exists independently of each other. Rather, everything is composed of "opposites" or contradictions, (e.g. life is meaningless without death). Under this logic, there are two kinds of change in the world: quantitative and qualitative, the former being accumulation (e.g. gravity accumulating the hydrogen gas) and the latter being transformation (e.g. enough hydrogen is accumulated to begin fusion). This is relevant to class struggle because is a dialectic between workers who want better conditions and capitalists who want more profit, and the only way to resolve the dialectic is for the struggle to intensify (quantitative change) to lead to the overthrow of the capitalists and the establishment of socialism (qualitative change). |
